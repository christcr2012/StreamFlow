 * Enterprise-grade billing policy for service business revenue operations.
 *
 * CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION: Basic flat-rate billing with Stripe integration
 * ENTERPRISE TARGET: Multi-dimensional usage-based billing with revenue recognition
 * 
 * Policy:

 *    PUT  /api/billing/subscriptions/{id}/change-plan
 *    POST /api/billing/subscriptions/{id}/usage
 *    GET  /api/billing/subscriptions/{id}/preview
 *    DELETE /api/billing/subscriptions/{id}/cancel
 * 
 * SPRINT 2 (Week 3-4): Usage Metering & Webhooks
 * 
 * 1. USAGE METERING SYSTEM:
 *    - Real-time usage tracking for leads, API calls, storage
 *    - Daily/monthly aggregation jobs
 *    - Usage limit enforcement and notifications
 *    - Overage billing calculation
 * 
 * 2. WEBHOOK-TO-QUEUE ARCHITECTURE:
 *    - Implement Redis queue for webhook processing
 *    - Idempotency using event IDs and database deduplication
 *    - Retry logic with exponential backoff
 *    - Dead letter queue for failed events
 *    - Webhook signature verification hardening
 * 
 * 3. REVENUE RECOGNITION BASICS:
 *    - Deferred revenue calculation for annual plans
 *    - Monthly revenue recognition for usage charges
 *    - Basic MRR/ARR reporting
 * 
 * 🔧 ENTERPRISE TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY:
 * =================================================
 * 
 * DATABASE OPTIMIZATION FOR BILLING PERFORMANCE:
 * - Partitioned billing tables by month for high-volume processing
 * - Materialized views for real-time revenue dashboards
 * - Indexed usage aggregation tables for fast bill calculation
 * - Event-sourced billing events for audit trail and replay capability
 * 
 * MICROSERVICES ARCHITECTURE:
 * - Usage Collection Service: Real-time event ingestion
 * - Billing Calculation Engine: Complex pricing rule execution
 * - Revenue Recognition Service: ASC 606 compliance automation
 * - Payment Processing Service: Multi-gateway payment orchestration
 * 
 * DATA INTEGRITY & COMPLIANCE:
 * - Immutable billing events with cryptographic signatures
 * - Double-entry bookkeeping for financial accuracy
 * - Automated reconciliation with payment processors
 * - SOX-compliant controls and audit trails
 * 
 * CLASSIFICATION NOTES:
 * Your Prisma enum LeadSource does NOT include `REFERRAL`.
 * We therefore classify referrals as:
 *   - MANUAL_EMPLOYEE_REFERRAL
 *   - MANUAL_EXISTING_CUSTOMER
 *   - MANUAL_NEW_CUSTOMER
 * And, defensively, any *string* containing "referral" is treated as referral.
