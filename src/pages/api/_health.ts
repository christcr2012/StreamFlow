=== ENTERPRISE ROADMAP: HEALTH CHECK & MONITORING API ===

CURRENT STATE vs ENTERPRISE STANDARDS:
- Basic health check endpoint with timestamp only
- No comprehensive system status monitoring
- Missing dependency health checks and circuit breakers
- No performance metrics or SLA monitoring

ENTERPRISE MONITORING COMPARISON (DataDog, New Relic, Prometheus, AWS CloudWatch):
1. Comprehensive Health Monitoring:
   - Multi-tier health checks (application, database, external services)
   - Circuit breaker patterns with automatic failover
   - Performance metrics with percentile tracking
   - Custom health indicators and business metrics

2. Observability Platform:
   - Distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry integration
   - Structured logging with correlation IDs
   - Real-time alerting with escalation policies
   - SLA monitoring with availability tracking

3. Enterprise Monitoring Features:
   - Multi-region health aggregation
   - Dependency mapping and impact analysis
   - Automated incident response and remediation
   - Compliance monitoring with audit trails

IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP:

ðŸ”¥ Phase 1: Advanced Health Monitoring (Week 1)
1. COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH CHECKS:
   - Database connectivity and performance checks
   - External service dependency monitoring (Stripe, Twilio, etc.)
   - Memory, CPU, and disk usage monitoring
   - Custom business logic health indicators

2. CIRCUIT BREAKER IMPLEMENTATION:
   - Automatic failover for degraded services
   - Gradual recovery with exponential backoff
   - Health status caching and propagation
   - Dependency isolation and bulkhead patterns

âš¡ Phase 2: Observability Platform (Week 2-3)
3. OPENTELEMETRY INTEGRATION:
   - Distributed tracing across all API endpoints
   - Custom metrics with business context
   - Span correlation with user sessions
   - Performance profiling and bottleneck detection

4. STRUCTURED LOGGING & ANALYTICS:
   - JSON-structured logs with correlation IDs
   - Log aggregation with ELK stack or Splunk
   - Real-time log analysis and pattern detection
   - Security event correlation and threat detection

ðŸš€ Phase 3: Enterprise Monitoring Platform (Month 2)
5. SLA MONITORING & ALERTING:
   - Availability and performance SLA tracking
   - Multi-channel alerting (Slack, PagerDuty, SMS)
   - Escalation policies with on-call rotations
   - Incident management with root cause analysis

6. BUSINESS METRICS & INTELLIGENCE:
   - Custom business KPI monitoring
   - Real-time dashboard with executive summaries
   - Predictive analytics for capacity planning
   - Cost optimization and resource allocation insights

ENTERPRISE FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT:
