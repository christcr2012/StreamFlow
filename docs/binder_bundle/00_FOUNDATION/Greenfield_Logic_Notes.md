# Greenfield Logic Notes (Reasoning Kept, Liability Pruned)

- **Everything installed Dayâ€‘1; costed features disabled** until prepaid/approved.
- **Owner Approval** required for enabling any cost-generating capability.
- **No live learning**: models are frozen; behavior controlled by versioned policy packs and per-tenant retrieval namespaces.
- **Security without audits**: strong isolation (RLS), encryption, secret rotation; do not ship SOC2/HIPAA frameworks.
- **Explainability**: concierge must explain why a migration/upgrade is recommended (cost vs margin).

These principles are codified into CI checks and acceptance criteria across modules.
