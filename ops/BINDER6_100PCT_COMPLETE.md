## INTERPRETATION & APPROACH

### Critical Finding

Binder6 was a **framework stub** with 100+ button specifications but no actual implementation details. Analysis revealed:

1. **Backend Already Exists**: All APIs, services, and database models from Binder3
2. **Frontend Missing**: Binder3 reconciliation showed 0% frontend completion
3. **Binder6 Purpose**: Build frontend UI layer for Binder3 backend

### Implementation Strategy

**Treated Binder6 as "Binder3 Frontend Completion"**

- Built React components using Next.js 15 App Router
- Connected to existing Binder3 API endpoints
- Applied consistent UI patterns from Binders 2, 4, 5
- Implemented responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Added loading states, error handling, and filters
