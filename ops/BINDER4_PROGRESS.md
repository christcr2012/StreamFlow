## STRATEGY

Given the massive scope of Binder4 (14 phases with hundreds of buttons), we'll implement in priority order:

**Priority 1 (Critical Path)**:
- CRM Core APIs (Leads, Contacts, Organizations already exist - enhance)
- Database schema updates for new features
- Core service layer enhancements

**Priority 2 (High Value)**:
- Scheduling & Dispatch basics
- Estimates & Invoices (extend existing)
- Customer Portal foundation

**Priority 3 (Future)**:
- Inventory & Procurement
- Subcontractors & Marketplace
- Multi-location Finance
- Deep Integrations
- AI Agents
- Advanced Security
- Comprehensive Tests
- Ops & Observability

## üîÑ PHASE 1: CRM CORE (IN PROGRESS)

### Current State Assessment

**Existing CRM Models** (from Binder2):
- ‚úÖ Lead - Basic lead tracking
- ‚úÖ Contact - Contact management
- ‚úÖ Organization - Organization/company management
- ‚úÖ Opportunity - Sales opportunities
- ‚úÖ Activity - Activity tracking

**Existing CRM APIs**:
- ‚úÖ GET/POST `/api/leads` - List & create leads
- ‚úÖ GET/PATCH/DELETE `/api/leads/[id]` - Lead CRUD
- ‚úÖ Similar endpoints for contacts, organizations, opportunities

### Enhancements Needed (from Binder4)

**Leads** (7 buttons):
- ‚è≥ Create Lead - Enhance with bu_id, idempotency
- ‚è≥ Update Lead - Add versioning
- ‚è≥ Convert to Customer - New endpoint
- ‚è≥ Merge Duplicates - New endpoint
- ‚è≥ Assign Owner - Enhance existing
- ‚è≥ Add Note - New endpoint
- ‚è≥ Attach File - New endpoint

**Contacts** (similar pattern):
- ‚è≥ Create/Update/Delete
- ‚è≥ Link to Organization
- ‚è≥ Add Note
- ‚è≥ Attach File

**Organizations** (similar pattern):
- ‚è≥ Create/Update/Delete
- ‚è≥ Add Contact
- ‚è≥ Add Note
- ‚è≥ Attach File

**Opportunities** (similar pattern):
- ‚è≥ Create/Update/Delete
- ‚è≥ Change Stage
- ‚è≥ Add Product/Service
- ‚è≥ Generate Estimate
- ‚è≥ Add Note

## IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH

### Phase 1A: Database Schema Updates
- Add versioning fields to existing models
- Add Note model (polymorphic)
- Add File/Attachment model (polymorphic)
- Add idempotency tracking
- Add bu_id to relevant models

### Phase 1B: Service Layer Enhancements
- Add versioning support
- Add idempotency checking
- Add note/file attachment methods
- Add merge/convert methods

### Phase 1C: API Enhancements
- Add idempotency-key header support
- Add 402 payment required responses
- Add versioning to responses
- Add new endpoints (convert, merge, notes, files)

### Phase 1D: Frontend Components
- Enhance existing CRM components
- Add note/file attachment UI
- Add merge/convert flows
- Add payment required banners

## NEXT STEPS

1. Assess existing CRM schema and identify gaps
2. Create migration for schema enhancements
3. Enhance CRM services with new methods
4. Add new API endpoints
5. Update frontend components
6. Add tests
7. Move to Phase 2 (Scheduling & Dispatch)

## NOTES

- Binder4 is massive (14 phases, hundreds of buttons)
- Focus on critical path: CRM enhancements, core scheduling, basic billing
- Many features already exist from Binder2 - enhance rather than rebuild
- Prioritize API contracts and service layer over UI polish
- Defer advanced features (AI agents, deep integrations) to later phases
