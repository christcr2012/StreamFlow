# StreamFlow Continuous Implementation Plan

**Purpose**: Enable AI agent to work continuously without stopping between phases  
**Date**: 2025-01-01  
**Status**: ACTIVE - Work continuously until all tasks complete

---

## 🎯 IMPLEMENTATION PHILOSOPHY

**Key Principle**: **NEVER STOP BETWEEN PHASES**

The AI agent should:
1. ✅ Complete current task
2. ✅ Commit and push changes
3. ✅ **IMMEDIATELY** start next task
4. ✅ Continue until ALL tasks in binder bundle are complete
5. ✅ Only stop when explicitly told by user OR all work is done

## 🚀 EXECUTION STRATEGY

### Continuous Work Pattern:

```
LOOP:
  1. Identify next highest-priority task
  2. Implement task completely
  3. Test (npx tsc --noEmit)
  4. Commit with descriptive message
  5. Push to GitHub
  6. GOTO step 1 (NO STOPPING)
END LOOP when all tasks complete
```

### Priority Order:

1. **HIGH PRIORITY** (Do First):
   - Provider authentication middleware
   - AI evaluation system
   - Caching layer
   - Background job queue

2. **MEDIUM PRIORITY** (Do Second):
   - Domain verification automation
   - Model versioning
   - Structured logging
   - Performance monitoring

3. **LOW PRIORITY** (Do Last):
   - UI polish
   - Documentation
   - Load testing
   - Customer portal

## 📊 PROGRESS TRACKING

### Current Status:
- **Phase 1.75**: 100% ✅
- **Phase 2**: 100% ✅
- **Phase 3**: 60% 🔄
- **Phase 4**: 50% 🔄
- **Phase 5**: 0% 📝
- **Phase 6**: 0% 📝

### Overall Completion: ~45%

### Remaining Work: ~110-135 hours

## 🔧 IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES

### Code Quality Standards:
- ✅ Zero TypeScript errors
- ✅ Zod validation on all inputs
- ✅ ServiceError for business logic errors
- ✅ Audit logging on all mutations
- ✅ Rate limiting on all endpoints
- ✅ Multi-tenant isolation (orgId scoping)
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling

### Commit Message Format:
```
feat: [feature name] - Phase X (Part Y)

Context: [brief context]
Implements [spec name] from binder bundle

[Details of what was implemented]

Features:
✅ [feature 1]
✅ [feature 2]

Status: Phase X - [percentage]% complete
Next: [what's next]
Zero TypeScript errors, all builds passing
```

### Testing Before Commit:
```bash
npx tsc --noEmit  # Must pass with 0 errors
```

## 🎯 NEXT IMMEDIATE TASKS

### Task 1: Provider Authentication Middleware (2-3 hours)
**File**: `src/middleware/providerAuth.ts`

- Rate limit provider requests
- Audit log all provider actions

### Task 2: AI Evaluation System (8-10 hours)
**Files**: 
- `src/server/services/aiEvaluationService.ts`
- `src/pages/api/provider/ai/evaluations.ts`

## 🚨 STOPPING CONDITIONS

The AI agent should ONLY stop when:

1. ✅ **All tasks in this plan are complete**
2. ✅ **User explicitly says "stop"**
3. ✅ **Critical error that requires user intervention**
4. ✅ **Waiting for external dependency (API keys, etc.)**

The AI agent should NEVER stop for:
- ❌ Completing a phase
- ❌ Reaching a milestone
- ❌ Finishing a feature
- ❌ Committing code
- ❌ Pushing to GitHub

**Always continue to the next task immediately!**
