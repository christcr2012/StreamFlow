## BONUS: APP ROUTER MIGRATION

**Completed**:
- ✅ Extracted all app router pages to `src/components/**`
- ✅ Created thin wrappers in `app/**` routes
- ✅ Deleted conflicting Pages Router files (leads.tsx, leads/[id].tsx, _app.tsx, _document.tsx)
- ✅ Added root layout for App Router
- ✅ Fixed TypeScript errors (useParams null checks, Suspense for useSearchParams)
- ✅ Verified 0 TypeScript errors
- ✅ Verified successful Next.js build
- ✅ No `@/pages/**` imports remain in codebase

**Result**: App Router is now canonical for UI routes; Pages Router retained only for API routes.
