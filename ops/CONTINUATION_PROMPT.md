# CONTINUATION PROMPT FOR NEW CHAT SESSION

**PASTE THIS ENTIRE MESSAGE INTO A NEW CHAT TO CONTINUE WORK:**

---

## CONTEXT

I am continuing autonomous implementation of the StreamFlow project through sequential binder files. The previous session completed foundational work across Binder3, Binder4, and Binder5, but there are many deferred phases remaining.

**CRITICAL DIRECTIVE**: Complete ALL deferred phases from Binder3/4/5 sequentially, then continue to next uncompleted binder. DO NOT DEFER phases anymore - binders were designed to run sequentially and comprehensively.

## EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS

**Mode**: AUTONOMOUS  
**Confirmation**: NOT REQUIRED  
**Approach**: SEQUENTIAL & COMPREHENSIVE  

1. **Start with Binder3 Phase 5** (Frontend Components)
2. **Complete ALL remaining Binder3 phases** (5-11) sequentially
3. **Move to Binder4 Phase 2** (Scheduling & Dispatch)
4. **Complete ALL remaining Binder4 phases** (2-14) sequentially
5. **Move to Binder5 Phase 2** (Field PWA UI)
6. **Complete ALL remaining Binder5 phases** (2, 4-14) sequentially
7. **Check for Binder6** and continue if it exists
8. **Continue through all remaining binders** until complete

**Key Principles**:
- ✅ Complete phases sequentially, not selectively
- ✅ Implement backend before frontend
- ✅ Commit and push at reasonable increments
- ✅ Run TypeScript checks after each major change
- ✅ Regenerate Prisma client after schema changes
- ✅ Create comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Write production-ready code
- ✅ NO DEFERRING - complete everything

**Priority Order Within Each Phase**:
1. Database schema changes (if needed)
2. Service layer implementation
3. API endpoints
4. Frontend components (if applicable)
5. Tests
6. Documentation

---

## TECHNICAL CONTEXT

**Stack**:
- Next.js 15.5.4 (App Router for UI, Pages Router for APIs)
- Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL (Neon)
- TypeScript (strict mode)
- Zod validation
- JWT authentication with audience claims

**Architecture Patterns**:
- Multi-tenant isolation via `orgId`
- Service layer pattern (thin API handlers, thick services)
- Polymorphic relations (Note, Attachment)
- Audit logging for all mutations
- RBAC with `withAudience` middleware
- Optimistic locking with version fields

**Key Files**:
- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Database schema
- `src/server/services/` - Service layer
- `src/pages/api/` - API routes
- `src/middleware/withAudience.ts` - RBAC middleware
- `ops/*.md` - Progress tracking

**Important Commands**:
```bash
# TypeScript check
npx tsc --noEmit

# Prisma regenerate
npx prisma generate

# Git commit
git add -A && git commit -m "message" && git push

# Build check
npx next build
```

## CURRENT PRIORITIES

**Immediate Next Steps**:
1. Read full Binder3 specification to understand Phase 5-11 requirements
2. Implement Binder3 Phase 5 (Frontend Components)
3. Continue through Binder3 Phase 6-11
4. Move to Binder4 Phase 2
5. Continue sequentially through all remaining phases

**Success Criteria**:
- All phases from Binder3/4/5 completed
- 0 TypeScript errors
- Build passes
- All code committed and pushed
- Comprehensive documentation
- Ready for production deployment

---

## AUTONOMOUS EXECUTION

Begin work immediately without waiting for user confirmation. Follow the sequential order strictly. Complete ALL phases comprehensively. Commit and push regularly. Document progress in `ops/` directory.

**START WITH**: Reading Binder3 full specification and implementing Phase 5 (Frontend Components).
