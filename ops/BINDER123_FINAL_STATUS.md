Continue autonomous implementation of StreamFlow Binder1, 2, and 3.

Current status:
- Binder1: 85% complete (idempotency, trials, guards complete)
- Binder2: 85% complete (CRM, bridges, FSM guards complete)
- Binder3: 70% complete (backend services complete, frontend pending)

Priority order:
1. Apply idempotency to all POST routes (2-3 hours)
2. Implement rate limiting infrastructure (3-4 hours)
3. Complete Binder3 frontend components (10-12 hours)
4. Add comprehensive test coverage (13-16 hours)
5. Complete security, ops, and acceptance (9-13 hours)

Build status: 0 TypeScript errors, all tests passing.
Token budget: 121k remaining (60.5%).

Begin with applying idempotency to existing POST routes.
```
