# StreamFlow Handover Binder Implementation Plan

**Date**: 2025-09-30  
**Session**: Autonomous Implementation  
**Source**: StreamFlow_Handover_Binder1.md (481 lines)  
**Status**: IN PROGRESS

---

## Executive Summary

This document tracks the implementation of the comprehensive handover binder specifications. The binder defines a complete production-ready multi-tenant SaaS platform with CRM, AI, and enterprise features.

**Key Constraints**:
- Keep current stack: Next.js/TS, Prisma, Postgres, Tailwind, Vercel
- Build to production level with security, observability, testing
- No scope creep - implement exactly what's specified
- All features must have acceptance criteria met

---

## Phase Breakdown

### Phase 1: Foundations (CURRENT)
**Goal**: Auth/RBAC, base schema, seed data, minimal dashboards, CI/CD gates, observability

**Done When**:
- [ ] Users can register, log in, view dashboard
- [ ] RBAC enforced
- [ ] Migrations reversible
- [ ] Smoke E2E passes
- [ ] Logs/metrics visible

**Estimated Time**: 20-30 hours

### Phase 2: Core CRM
**Goal**: Leads/Orgs/Contacts/Opps/Tasks CRUD, search, import, notes, assignment

**Done When**:
- [ ] All CRUD + import works
- [ ] Audit populated
- [ ] Rate limits present
- [ ] Partitioning live
- [ ] Coverage ≥80% on touched areas

**Estimated Time**: 40-50 hours

### Phase 3: AI Differentiators
**Goal**: Assistant, enrichment, summarization; metrics & cost capping

**Done When**:
- [ ] AI improves task completion
- [ ] Cost within budget
- [ ] Fallbacks always safe

**Estimated Time**: 30-40 hours

### Phase 4: Enterprise Polish
**Goal**: SOC 2 controls, SSO, webhooks, SDKs, load tests

**Done When**:
- [ ] Security review passes
- [ ] SLOs met under load
- [ ] Incident & rollback drills complete

**Estimated Time**: 30-40 hours

**Total Estimated Time**: 120-160 hours

## Current Session Plan

### Immediate Tasks (Phase 1 - Foundations)

#### 1. System Map & Architecture (2-3 hours)
- [ ] Review existing file structure
- [ ] Create missing directories (`src/server/services`, `src/server/ai`)
- [ ] Set up proper App Router structure
- [ ] Document architecture decisions

#### 2. Database Schema & Migrations (4-6 hours)
- [ ] Review existing Prisma schema
- [ ] Implement handover binder models:
  - Tenant, User, Role, UserRole
  - Organization, Contact, LeadSource, Lead
  - Opportunity, Activity, Task
  - AuditLog (partitioned), Job, WebhookEvent
- [ ] Add indexes and constraints
- [ ] Create migration files
- [ ] Test migrations (up/down)
- [ ] Create seed data

#### 3. Auth System (6-8 hours)
- [ ] Implement login page (`src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx`)
- [ ] Implement register page (`src/app/(auth)/register/page.tsx`)
- [ ] Implement forgot/reset password
- [ ] Create auth API routes (`/api/auth/*`)
- [ ] Implement JWT + refresh token system
- [ ] Add httpOnly cookies
- [ ] Implement rate limiting
- [ ] Add audit logging for auth events
- [ ] Write auth tests

#### 4. RBAC System (4-5 hours)
- [ ] Create RBAC middleware
- [ ] Implement Prisma tenant-scope injection
- [ ] Create permission checking utilities
- [ ] Implement `/api/me` endpoint
- [ ] Implement `/api/roles` endpoints (admin)
- [ ] Write RBAC tests

#### 5. Dashboard & Base UI (3-4 hours)
- [ ] Create dashboard page (`src/app/(app)/dashboard/page.tsx`)
- [ ] Implement basic widgets (My Leads, Tasks Due, Pipeline)
- [ ] Add loading skeletons
- [ ] Add error boundaries
- [ ] Implement responsive layout

#### 6. Observability Bootstrap (2-3 hours)
- [ ] Set up structured logging (requestId, tenantId)
- [ ] Add error tracking integration
- [ ] Create basic metrics endpoints
- [ ] Set up log aggregation

#### 7. CI/CD Gates (2-3 hours)
- [ ] Configure TypeScript strict mode
- [ ] Set up ESLint strict rules
- [ ] Add pre-commit hooks
- [ ] Configure test coverage gates
- [ ] Add security scanning (gitleaks)

## Implementation Notes

### Resolved Defaults (from Binder)
- **Billing**: Stripe Billing + Customer Portal
- **Background Jobs**: BullMQ + Redis
- **Observability**: OpenTelemetry → Prometheus/Grafana/Loki/Tempo
- **SSO**: Auth.js OIDC (Google/Microsoft); SAML optional later
- **Data residency**: US default; EU via region-aware tenant DB shard

### Performance Budgets
- p95 latencies: GET ≤300ms, POST ≤800ms, AI ≤2.5s
- Throughput: 250 RPS steady, 1000 RPS burst
- Max tenant size: 1M leads, 2M contacts, 100k orgs, 500k opps, 10M activities
- Concurrency: 500 active users/region; import 50k rows/min/worker
- Cache hit ≥70%; DB queries p95 <50ms
- SLO: 99.9% uptime; ≤0.1% 5xx

### Key Architectural Decisions
1. **Multi-tenant**: Row-level isolation (not per-schema)
2. **Auth**: JWT + refresh token with httpOnly cookies
3. **API**: Standard error envelope, idempotency keys, rate limits
4. **Database**: Partitioned audit logs, trigram search indexes
5. **AI**: Server-only, redaction, prompt-injection defense
6. **Testing**: ≥80% coverage, contract tests, E2E smoke tests

### Blocked
- None

### Next Steps
1. Review existing codebase structure
2. Assess what's already built vs what needs building
3. Start with database schema implementation
4. Build auth system
5. Implement RBAC

## Git Commit Strategy

**Commit Frequency**: Every 2-3 hours or at logical checkpoints
**Commit Message Format**: `<type>: <description>`

**Types**:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `refactor`: Code restructuring
- `test`: Adding tests
- `docs`: Documentation
- `chore`: Maintenance

**Push Strategy**: After each major milestone or every 3-4 commits

---

## Vercel Deployment Verification

**Check Points**:
- After database schema changes
- After auth system implementation
- After major API changes
- Before ending session

**Verification Steps**:
1. Run `npm run build` locally
2. Check for TypeScript errors
3. Check for build warnings
4. Verify all pages generate
5. Test critical paths
