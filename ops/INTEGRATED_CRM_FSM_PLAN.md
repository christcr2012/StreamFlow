# Integrated CRM + FSM Implementation Plan

**Date**: 2025-01-01  
**Status**: IN PROGRESS  
**Approach**: CRM as supplement to FSM, fully integrated with bridge systems

---

## üéØ CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING

**DO NOT SILO CRM AND FSM**

CRM and FSM are **one integrated system**:
- Jobs link to CRM Orgs/Contacts via foreign keys
- Quotes/Estimates link to CRM Opportunities
- Leads convert to FSM Customers (Org + Contact)
- All mutations audited
- All AI routes cost-guarded
- Unified testing and CI/CD

## üîó BRIDGE SYSTEM DETAILS

### 1. Lead ‚Üí Customer Conversion

**API**: `POST /api/tenant/crm/leads/:id/convert`

**Request**:
```json

{
  "customerId": "cus_123",
  "organizationId": "org_456",
  "contactId": "con_789",
  "auditId": "aud_abc"
}
```

**Logic**:
1. Check if lead already converted (idempotent)
2. Create/link Organization

5. Update Lead with conversion data
6. Create audit log entry
7. Return all IDs
