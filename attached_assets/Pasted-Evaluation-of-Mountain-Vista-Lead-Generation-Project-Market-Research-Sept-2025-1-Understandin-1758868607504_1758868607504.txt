Evaluation of Mountain Vista Lead‑Generation
Project & Market Research (Sept 2025)
1. Understanding the Current Project
Repository structure (from prior exploration)
Next.js front‑end – the project uses a TypeScript Next.js app with pages such as /leads , /
billing , /settings and /provider . Lead pages show lead details, allow marking a lead as
Converted and display conversion status. Billing pages show usage totals and draft invoices. Settings
pages allow the client to set provider API keys and billing preferences. Many pages leverage shadcn/
ui components for tables and forms.
API routes – serverless functions in /pages/api/… handle lead fetching and updates. For
example sam/fetch.ts fetches new leads from SAM.gov and normalizes them; leads.tsx lists
leads; leads/[id].ts updates a lead’s status and conversion flag; billing/preview.tsx
produces draft invoices summarizing converted leads at $100 per lead; and stripe/webhook.ts
updates invoice status after payment.
Lead attribution & scoring – new leads are tagged with a source_type ( SYSTEM ,
EMPLOYEE_REFERRAL , MANUAL_ENTRY ) and optional source_details (campaign, referral
employee). Only system‑generated leads are billable. A simple lead‑scoring adapter maps attributes
(industry, contract value, etc.) to a numeric score; manual overrides are available. A
leadConversion event triggers billing logic when a lead’s is_converted flag is set.
Billing & invoicing – a billing service records each converted, billable lead and aggregates them at
period‑end. The system integrates with Stripe for invoicing; invoices show the number of converted
leads and the total charge (e.g. “7 × $100” in phase 2). Payment status is updated via Stripe
webhooks. The architecture is modular so pricing logic can evolve.
Anti‑fraud logic – the data model prevents clients from editing source_type . Audit logs capture
any changes to source attribution and conversion status. Non‑billable sources (manual entry,
employee referrals) are permanently exempt. Duplicate detection and dispute workflows allow the
owner to flag leads and receive credit on the next invoice. The design emphasises transparent
line‑item invoices and robust source attribution.
Real‑time dashboard – the owner dashboard shows the running count of converted, billable leads
and an estimated invoice total; this reduces invoice shock by providing visibility during the billing
period.
Existing roadmap (summary)
Phase   2 introduces conversion‑based billing with $100/lead pricing, monthly draft invoices, Stripe
integration and an invoice page. Phase 3 adds an RFP parser and bid helper that extracts key information
from uploaded RFP PDFs/DOCX files (scope, due dates, walkthroughs, insurance/bond requirements) and
creates a checklist; an optional AI summary highlights important points. Parsed briefs attach to the lead.
Phase 4 focuses on disputes & anti‑gaming with audit logs, dispute workflows and an admin tool for

reclassifying leads and issuing credits. Phase 5 is polish & white‑label, giving the interface a shadcn/ui
makeover and introducing brand configuration (name, colours, logo) plus settings/profile pages. Phase 6
proposes optional accelerators: prepaid lead packs, tiered pricing, additional lead sources (LSA and state/
county portals) and hybrid base/usage plans. Success criteria include accurate lead fetching,
conversion‑based billing, Stripe‑powered invoices, permanent free employee referrals, dispute resolution
and a polished, white‑label interface.
2. Market Research: Sources & Tools for Premium Lead Generation
Government procurement platforms
Samsearch – Samsearch aggregates federal, state and local procurement data (SAM.gov,
FedBizOpps, GSA schedules, DIBBS, etc.) and uses AI to match opportunities to a firm’s capabilities. It
monitors more than 10 000 government websites and allows filtering by NAICS codes, geographic
region, contract value and deadlines . Advanced features include AI‑generated summaries of
RFPs, competitor analysis and win‑probability scoring .
SAM.gov – the official U.S. federal contracting portal. All opportunities over $25 k are posted here
. Registration is mandatory for federal contracting.
GovWin (Deltek) and Bloomberg Government – enterprise‑level platforms providing long‑range
spending forecasts and analytics .
BidNet Direct – organizes bids and RFPs from state and local agencies into regional purchasing
groups. Vendors can register to receive matched opportunities; the platform sends automatic
notifications when new bids match a vendor’s criteria . The site lists purchasing groups for every
state and allows vendors to access exclusive opportunities .
These sources show that beyond SAM.gov there are many SLED (state, local, education) portals and
specialized bid boards (DIBBS for defence, NASA SEWP, state purchasing portals). Integrating more of these
sources will increase available leads.
Local online advertising: Google Local Services Ads (LSA)
Local Services Ads are pay‑per‑lead ads for service‑oriented businesses. An LSA appears at the top of
Google search results and displays the business name, star rating, hours, and a call or message button .
LSAs differ from standard Google Ads because:
Pay per lead – businesses pay only when a consumer contacts them through the ad . Google sets
a fixed cost per lead by industry and location .
Budget control – advertisers choose the number of leads they want per week, making costs
predictable .
High visibility & trust – LSAs appear above normal ads and include a “Google Guarantee” badge if
the business passes verification; the badge enhances consumer trust .
Refunds for invalid leads – advertisers can request refunds for spam or irrelevant leads .
These features make LSAs an attractive low‑risk channel for service businesses. Integrating LSA lead
retrieval and verification into the platform can broaden lead sources and create another revenue stream.

capabilities—such as automated email sequences, segmentation, lead scoring and A/B testing—can
significantly improve lead quantity and quality.
3. Recommendations for Building an Ultra‑Premium, Low‑Cost
Platform
Based on the existing project and market research, the following roadmap enhancements and new features
will elevate the product while keeping costs manageable:
3.1 Expand Lead Sources
Integrate state and local procurement portals – Extend the existing SAM.gov integration to
include additional SLED portals. Use scraping or API connectors to fetch opportunities from BidNet
Direct and individual state procurement sites. Vendors registered with regional purchasing groups
receive automatic bid notifications ; tapping into these feeds will increase the volume of RFPs and
opportunities for clients.
Leverage Samsearch’s AI‑powered government contracting data – Use Samsearch (or a similar
aggregator) to access consolidated federal, state and local procurement data and AI‑generated
opportunity matches . This reduces the complexity of maintaining multiple scrapers and provides
enriched metadata like NAICS codes, deadlines and win‑probability scores.
Add Google Local Services Ads integration – Provide clients with an interface to manage LSAs,
import leads and track ROI. Emphasize LSAs’ pay‑per‑lead pricing , fixed cost per lead , budget
control and refund options . Integrating LSAs will generate consumer leads beyond government
procurement and offers predictable costs.
Offer curated private sector leads – Partner with commercial lead‑generation providers (CallPage,
AeroLeads, LeadFuze) to feed high‑value B2B opportunities. Provide clients with optional paid lead
packs; design the system so that premium leads (e.g. from LeadFuze or Samsearch) are priced
higher while still preserving the pay‑per‑conversion model.
3.2 Enhance Lead Management & Automation
RFP parser and bid assistant (Phase 3) – Implement a local text‑extraction service using
open‑source libraries (e.g. pdfplumber , docx2txt ) to extract content from uploaded RFP
documents. Use natural‑language processing to detect dates, scope, insurance/bond requirements
and create a checklist. Offer an optional AI summarization feature that uses a generative model to
produce talking points. Store the parsed summary and checklist on the lead record for easy
reference. Provide a “Send to Proposal Builder” button to generate template responses.
Advanced lead scoring & segmentation – Expand the current scoring adapter to include
machine‑learning models that consider historical conversion rates by source, value and buyer
personas. Integrate marketing‑automation features such as automated nurturing sequences
triggered by lead score thresholds. Use segmentation to deliver personalised content via email or
SMS.
CRM integrations – Offer connectors to popular CRMs (Pipedrive, HubSpot, Agile CRM). Use
LeadsBridge‑style integrations to automatically push generated leads into the client’s CRM and pull
back status updates . Provide configuration UI for mapping fields and controlling when leads
sync.

Automation & analytics – Add marketing‑automation capabilities: behaviour‑based email
sequences, campaign tracking, A/B testing, web‑tracking and lead scoring. Invesp’s research shows
automation can increase sales productivity and reduce marketing overhead ; offering these
features will make the product more competitive. Provide analytics dashboards that show conversion
rates by source, cost per conversion, ROI and pipeline velocity.
3.3 Billing & Pricing Improvements
Conversion‑based billing – Keep the $100/lead flat rate for system‑generated leads (Phase 2).
Provide volume discounts or tiered pricing as optional features (Phase 6). Use pre‑paid lead packs
where clients deposit funds and the system deducts credits upon conversion.
Hybrid subscription model – Offer a small monthly base fee to cover platform usage (e.g. analytics
and management features) plus per‑lead charges. Provide transparent breakdowns so clients know
exactly what they are paying for.
Multi‑currency & taxation – Design invoices to support multiple currencies and automatically apply
taxes based on the client’s location and lead source (future enhancement recommended in the PDF).
Smart invoicing – Continue using Stripe for invoice creation and payment collection. Provide a
real‑time invoice preview on the dashboard and allow clients to download a CSV of billed leads.
Implement auto‑retry logic for failed payments and email reminders.
3.4 Trust & Fairness Mechanisms
Enhanced anti‑gaming – Extend audit logging to capture any changes to source attribution,
conversion status or invoice adjustments. Use duplicate detection to flag leads imported multiple
times and automatically merge duplicates. Provide a dispute workflow where clients can flag leads
for review; admin can approve or deny disputes and issue credits.
Lead quality guarantees – Offer a quality guarantee (similar to Google’s guarantee badge) for leads
that meet defined criteria (complete contact information, within the target region, etc.). Credits or
refunds could be issued for invalid leads, building trust with clients.
Compliance & verification – For LSA leads, implement checks for business verification, licensing
and insurance as required by Google LSA guidelines . For government leads, validate vendor
eligibility (e.g. registration in SAM.gov, NAICS codes) before presenting leads.
3.5 Polished UI & White‑Labeling (Phase 5)
Adopt the shadcn/ui design system across the app to create consistent, modern components
(tables, buttons, forms). Use environment variables to load branding (logo, colours, company name)
so the platform can be re‑branded for different clients with minimal configuration. Provide a settings
page where clients can update their organisation profile, payment method (Stripe portal) and
manage users.
Build modular dashboard widgets that show conversion metrics, lead sources, ROI and invoice
previews. Allow clients to rearrange or hide widgets based on their priorities.

3.6 Optional Accelerators (Phase 6)
Lead packs & credit balance – Implement a wallet system where clients purchase bundles of leads
at a discount; each conversion deducts credit from their balance. Show remaining credits and
upcoming replenishment suggestions.
Tiered pricing & hybrid plans – Provide discount tiers based on monthly conversion volume. For
example, $100/lead up to 10 leads, $90/lead for 11–30 leads, and $80/lead beyond. Clients with high
volumes get better rates while the platform maintains predictable revenue.
Additional lead sources – After integrating state portals and LSAs, explore partnerships with
franchise directories, property‑management associations, or industry‑specific networks to generate
unique leads. Normalise these leads to the existing lead model for scoring and conversion tracking.
4. Next Steps
Prioritise Phase 2 implementation – Finalise conversion‑based billing and Stripe integration.
Provide clear invoices showing number of billable leads and allow the owner to preview charges
during the month.
Research and prototype data ingestion from state procurement portals and LSAs. Assess API
availability and scraping constraints. Build adapters to normalise leads into the existing schema.
Develop the RFP parser – Build a micro‑service for PDF/DOCX extraction and create UI for
uploading files. Start with rule‑based extraction of due dates, scope keywords and mandatory
requirements; later add AI summarisation.
Design the enhanced UI – Prepare a design system using shadcn/ui, focusing on readability and
spacing. Implement brand configuration via environment variables.
Plan marketing‑automation features – Evaluate open‑source or low‑cost marketing‑automation
libraries and define triggers for drip campaigns, follow‑ups and lead nurturing.
Set up analytics & reporting – Define key metrics (conversion rate by source, cost per conversion,
ROI). Use data visualisation libraries to add charts and tables to the dashboard.
By expanding lead sources, integrating automation, and improving billing and UI/UX, the Mountain Vista
platform can evolve into an ultra‑premium, low‑cost lead‑generation system. Leveraging AI‑powered
opportunity matching and marketing automation will help clients acquire more qualified leads while
maintaining transparency and fairness in billing.
