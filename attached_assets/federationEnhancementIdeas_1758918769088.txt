Provider-side functions to build (no client UI required)

A) Federation control plane (multi-system, multi-tenant)

1. Federated Client Directory – CRUD for client orgs, keys, webhooks, plans, last-seen; shown in your /provider/dashboard/clients. Add bulk import + validity checks. 


2. Key & Signature Ops – Key rotation (dual-valid window), per-org rate limits & size caps surfaced in UI. Mirrors your HMAC header model and security validations.  


3. Webhook Gateway (Provider→Client) – Signed callbacks for escalation.acknowledged|status_changed|invoice.accepted|invoice.failed so clients don’t poll; tie to each org’s webhookEndpoint. 


4. API Versioning + Idempotency – /v1/*, Idempotency-Key with safe retries for /escalation and /billing/invoice; expose GET /api/federation/status with version & health. 


5. Audit & Compliance Hub – Immutable, cross-client audit of every federation request + provider actions; export to SIEM with redaction guarantees. 



B) Incident & escalation operations (provider only)

6. Escalation Inbox – Central queue fed by POST /api/federation/escalation; auto-create provider ticket IDs, dedupe by escalationId, and link to runbooks. 


7. Lifecycle Tracking – States: received → sandbox_created → pr_opened → canary_requested → rolled_out | rolled_back with timestamps; these mirror your AI Dev Tool feedback loop. 


8. SLA/SLO Board – Per-client targets for acknowledge/resolve; alerts when P95 acknowledge or sandbox-create breaches. (Uses the AI Dev Tool’s SLI view.) 



C) Billing & revenue ops (provider-side mediation)

9. Invoice Mediation – Receive /billing/invoice, validate, forward to Stripe (or adapter), reconcile by client org/lead source; show cross-client revenue trends.  


10. Disputes & Write-offs – Provider-only workflows to mark disputes, issue credits, or hold payouts without exposing client PII (operational metrics only). 


11. Budgets & Kill-switches – Per-client spend/usage ceilings that auto-emit budget_exhausted_halt to the AI Dev Tool and pause costly automation. 



D) Provider “Marketplace” & packaging (for your multiple software systems)

12. Product & Bundle Catalog – Define your own SKUs (LeadGen, CRM, Accounting, Marketing), versions, dependencies, and per-plan entitlements (basic/premium/enterprise). 


13. Release Channels – Internal/Dev/GA tracks with deprecation timers; map feature-flags to channels for safe provider-level rollouts across many clients. (Pairs with canary limits.) 


14. Change Broadcasts – Provider announcements API (schema-version changes, pricing updates) with signed delivery to client systems; includes ack and reach metrics. 



E) Governance & access (provider staff only)

15. Role Simulator & Impersonation (Read-only) – Provider-safe views for troubleshooting with explicit consent banners, TTL, and no writes—wired to your roles. 


16. Approval Workbench – One place to approve: flags.rollout_beyond_internal, patch_pipeline.promote_canary, db.migration.apply, etc., per your workflows/policies.  


17. Policy Engine as Code – Enforce least-privilege, tenant isolation, step-up MFA, time-boxed elevation; configurable retention for audit/recordings. 



F) Cross-client analytics (strictly operational, no PII)

18. Role Insights & Error Heatmaps – Aggregate by role/feature/tenant cohort; find systemic regressions across your products. 


19. Federation Analytics API – GET /api/federation/analytics?from&to&org&severity&page=… with stable cursors; backs /analytics in your portal.  


20. Fraud/Abuse Signals – Spike detection on escalations and token/automation usage to protect provider resources. (Fits your “Advanced Features”.)

How the AI Dev Tool fits inside the Provider Federation Portal

Think of it as your Provider AI Developer module, not a client feature:

Landing dashboard panels live in provider portal: Incident Inbox, Role Insights, Feature-Flag Matrix, Sandbox Manager, Approvals Queue, Telemetry Overview. 

Tools & Guardrails are provider-scoped: Observability.Read (redacted), Sandbox.CreateFromMask, PatchPipeline.OpenPR, Flags.CanarySet (≤5%, internal cohorts only, approval required), Flags.Rollout with auto-rollback SLOs, DB.Migration via CI—not direct SQL.   

Roles & Approvals: AI_Developer, Provider_Admin, BreakGlass_Developer with JIT elevation, step-up MFA, immutable audit, and tenant-owner consent only when a tenant is touched—still all managed from the provider side.  

Status feedback to clients uses the webhook gateway: received/sandbox_created/pr_opened/canary_requested/rolled_out/rolled_back.

API & UI enhancements (provider-only) to implement next

Add POST /api/federation/callbacks/register (per-org webhook URL, HMAC secret) and emit signed events for escalation/billing states. 

Harden request handling with Idempotency-Key, nonce cache within your 5-minute clock-skew window, and body hash in the string-to-sign—keeps the provider surface safe while staying stateless. 

Expose portal sections exactly as your structure lists: Clients / Escalations / Billing / Analytics / Settings. (All provider-only.) 

Wire the AI Dev Tool panels into the provider dashboard and gate write-paths behind approvals/policies/quotas you’ve defined.

Provider-side “quick wins”

1. Escalation Inbox + Webhooks: Acknowledge, state machine, outbound events. 


2. Billing Mediation UI: Ingest /billing/invoice, reconcile, and show cross-client revenue w/ disputes. 


3. Approval Workbench: Centralize all approvals from the AI Dev Tool policies. 


4. Key Rotation & Rate-Limit Controls: Safer federation at scale.
