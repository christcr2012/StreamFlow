  "goal": "Allow the Owner to design, configure, and assign fully custom roles with granular permissions to fit any organizational structure or industry.",
  "scope": "Tenant-specific; Owner controls all custom role creation and assignment within their business.",
  "capabilities": {
    "role_creation": [
      "Create new roles from scratch or clone existing roles (Owner, Staff, Accountant, etc.)",
      "Define custom role names, descriptions, and organizational tags (e.g. department, location, team)"
    ],
    "permission_granularity": [
      "Toggle individual permissions (CRUD per resource: customers, staff, schedules, finances, integrations)",
      "Scope permissions by project, team, or geography",
      "Bundle permissions into reusable sets (e.g., 'Supervisor Pack')"
    ],
    "role_management": [
      "Edit or delete custom roles at any time",

  "constraints_and_safeguards": [
    "Custom roles cannot exceed the Ownerâ€™s authority (e.g. cannot create another Owner)",
    "Owner can enforce MFA, IP restrictions, or time-based access on custom roles",
    "System enforces least privilege defaults and flags overly broad roles for review"

  "audit_and_compliance": {
    "logging": "All role creation, edits, and assignments logged immutably",
    "reviews": "Prompt Owner for periodic reviews of custom roles to prevent role creep",
