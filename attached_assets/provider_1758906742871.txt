  "capabilities": {
    "service_management": [
      "Enable/disable product modules and feature flags available to tenants",
      "Configure industry-specific templates (e.g., cleaning, healthcare, retail) and roll them out per tenant",
      "Manage AI/automation features exposed to tenants, including usage policies and limits"
    ],
    "system_monitoring": [
      "View tenant-level usage analytics and adoption metrics (aggregated, anonymized when possible)",
      "Track resource consumption (compute, storage, AI tokens, billing metrics)",
      "Identify performance issues, errors, and compliance risks across tenants"
    ],
    "support_tools": [
      "Impersonate tenant users for troubleshooting (with Owner consent and full audit logging)",
      "Trigger diagnostic reports, health checks, and secure support sessions"
    ],
    "compliance_and_security": [
      "Enforce baseline security policies (MFA required, password strength, encryption at rest/in-transit)",

      "Push security patches, hotfixes, and forced updates across all tenants"
    ],

    ]
  },
  "constraints_and_safeguards": [
    "Provider role cannot access tenant business records (customers, staff, operations, or finances)",
    "All Provider actions logged with immutable audit trail and visible to affected tenants (e.g., banner: 'Provider made a change')",

  },
  "audit_and_compliance": {
    "system_wide_logging": "Centralized logging of Provider actions, exportable for audits",
    "compliance": "Align with SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR; respect tenant-level data residency requirements",
    "notification": "Tenants notified of feature changes, policy updates, or forced upgrades"

  "provisioning_flows": {
    "role_assignment": "Reserved for system/service provider admins only, not tenant users",
    "onboarding": "Includes secure setup of SSO, MFA, and access to provider portal",
    "offboarding": "Revocation immediately severs access to all tenants; logs retained"
  },
  "notes": "Provider has meta-level control to adapt the platform for different industries and tenants, while preserving strict tenant data isolation. Focused on service delivery, compliance, and support, not business management."
