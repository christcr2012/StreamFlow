## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

**Environment Variable Management:**
- Use Replit secrets for convenience while working in Replit
- Manually maintain .env file for cross-platform compatibility (GitHub/Vercel/Neon workflow)
- CRITICAL: Never clear, delete, or modify the .env file - user manages this manually
- Dual approach provides both Replit convenience and external development portability
