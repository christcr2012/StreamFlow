# StreamFlow Differentiation Principles

1) **AI does real work**; not just a chatbot.  
2) **Baseline AI included**; premium AI selectively monetized.  
3) **Tenant control**: power levels, role ceilings, caps.  
4) **Provider control**: trials, profitability dashboards, infra migration buttons.  
5) **Vertical-first UX**: industry tasks ready on day one.  
6) **Security without audit burden**: RLS, encryption, secrets rotation, audit logs.
