# StreamFlow JointPack (One-Click Local Expansion)
Generated: 2025-10-03T02:41:32.958005Z

This pack expands your existing Binder files on your **Windows 11** desktop into their **fully-expanded** versions, offline, within your repo folder. 
It also chains binders so AugmentCode (Claude 4.5) can run them sequentially without handholding.

## What this JointPack does

1. **Binder Expansion (local)**  
   - Reads every `binder*.md` in your chosen folder (and subfolders).  
   - Applies rule packs (RBAC, Vertical catalogs, API integrations, ULAP monetization, AI flows).  
   - Expands each binder into a `*_FULL.md` sibling file (maximally detailed, no fluff).  
   - Leaves your **original binders untouched**.

2. **Auto-Chaining**  
   - Inserts footer directives so AugmentCode will automatically continue to the **next binder** (numerical order) when each one completes.  
   - Supports split binders like `binder3A.md`, `binder3B.md`, `binder3C.md`.

3. **Safety & Validation**  
   - Pre-flight scans for conflicting files (e.g., `pages/` vs `app/` duplicates) and flags them in `EXPAND-REPORT.md`.  
   - Validates rule packs, detects missing env vars and placeholder secrets.  
   - Creates a `contracts-snapshot.json` and a diff against the previous snapshot if present.

## Quick Start (Windows 11)

1) **Unzip** this JointPack anywhere (e.g., `C:\Users\You\Desktop\JointPack`).  
2) Copy the **JointPack** folder into the folder that contains your existing binders (e.g., your repo root where `binder1.md` lives).  
3) Double-click **`run_expand_all.bat`**  
   - Choose your binders folder when prompted.  
   - The script will: expand all binders → write `*_FULL.md` → write `EXPAND-REPORT.md`.

4) In VS Code with **AugmentCode (Claude 4.5)**, open your repo and run:  
   - Prompt: _“Use the FULL binders only. Execute each in numerical order. Do not re-run non-FULL binders.”_

5) After coding completes, push to GitHub and deploy.

## Non-Goals

- We do **not** transmit your binders or expanded content anywhere. Everything runs locally.  
- We do **not** replace your original binders; we write sibling `_FULL.md` files.

---

## Troubleshooting

- If a binder refuses to expand, check `EXPAND-REPORT.md` for missing rule packs (e.g., a vertical pack name used but not present).  
- If you see Next.js “conflicting app and page files”: delete or rename duplicate pairs before building.  
- If Augment stops mid-sequence, ensure each binder’s footer includes a `NEXT_BINDER:` directive pointing to the next FULL file.

Have fun, ship safe.
